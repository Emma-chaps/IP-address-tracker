# React IP Adress Tracker

It was my first React challenge after 2 weeks learning React. 

## Challenge

>The challenge: to build an IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close as possible to the design provided by [frontmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0). To get the IP Address locations, I used the [IP Geolocation API](https://geo.ipify.org/) by IPify. To generate the map, I used [Google Map API](https://www.google.fr/maps).

>Users of the app should be able to:
- See their own IP Address on the map when clicked on "Locate Me" Button.
- Search for any IP addresses and see the key information and location
- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Add a .env file with your Google API Key
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.
